\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Continuous policy gradients applied to the Pendulum environment. Both seeds converge to rewards of at least $-300$. I used the default hyperparameters, but cut off the plot as soon as the results converged, which was at around $700000$ steps. The default hyperparameters used were: $\gamma = 0.97$, n\_iter=$300$,initial\_stepsize=1e-3, desired\_kl=2e-3, min\_timesteps\_per\_batch=$2500$. As seen above, the algorithm learned in around $650000$ to $700000$ steps.}}{1}}
